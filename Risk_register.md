The bank is located in a coastal area with low crime rates. Many people and systems handle the bank's dataâ€”100 on-premise employees and 20 remote employees. The customer base of the bank includes 2,000 individual accounts and 200 commercial accounts. The bank's services are marketed by a professional sports team and ten local businesses in the community. There are strict financial regulations that require the bank to secure their data and funds, like having enough cash available each day to meet Federal Reserve requirements.

| Notes | How are security events possible considering the risks the asset faces in its operating environment? Inadequate mitigation of inherent risks present in an asset's operating environment may inevitably lead to the occurrence of security events. To mitigate such risks, it is essential to adopt a proactive approach through proper identification, evaluation, and implementation of security measures. Without immediate security measures, certain assets, such as customer data and backup data stored on a database server, are prone to vulnerability. Additionally, there is a high possibility of confidential information being shared if an employee were to respond to a phishing email. It is, therefore, imperative to take necessary precautions to prevent such events from occurring by implementing robust security measures. |                                                               |            |          |          |
